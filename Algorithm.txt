Now, let's break down the code:

We define a function twoSum that takes an array nums and a target number target as input.

Inside the function, we create a new Map object named hashMap. This map will store the elements of the array as keys and their indices as values.

We start a for loop to iterate through the array nums using the index i.

Inside the loop, we calculate the complement value by subtracting the current element nums[i] from the target.

We check if the hashMap already has the complement value as a key using the has method. If it does, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target.

If the complement exists in the hashMap, we retrieve its corresponding index using the get method and return the indices of the two numbers as an array, [hashMap.get(complement), i].

If the complement does not exist in the hashMap, we add the current element nums[i] as a key and its index i as the corresponding value in the hashMap using the set method.

After the loop, if no solution is found, we return an empty array [].

This algorithm utilizes the Map data structure to store elements and their indices,
allowing us to perform constant time lookups to find the complement. By iterating through the array once,
the algorithm achieves a time complexity of O(n), making it more efficient than a brute-force solution
with a time complexity of O(n^2).
